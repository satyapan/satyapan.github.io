        <p><strong>Observations of a "dark" field for 21-cm cosmology with NenuFAR:</strong> In our first analysis of NenuFAR data, we found that one of the main limiting factors preventing the detection of the signal with NenuFAR is the strong astrophysical foreground emission coming in through the primary beam grating lobes, far from the field of view. To overcome this difficulty, we initiated a survey of six different fields with NenuFAR, carefully chosen to minimize contamination from bright radio sources and diffuse galactic emission. A preliminary analysis of the data from this survey shows promising results and one of the fields has been chosen for deep integration. I am processing multiple nights of observations of this field, to derive strong upper limits on the 21-cm signal that will allow us to constrain astrophysical parameters during the Cosmic Dawn. </p>

        <p><strong>Characterization of local RFI:</strong> In our first analysis of NenuFAR data, we found that a local RFI source is one of the major contributors to the excess power seen in the data that limits our ability to detect the 21-cm signal. The RFI is likely caused by air conditioning units located in a building housing electronic cabinets, right in the middle of the NenuFAR core. I have developed near-field imaging techniques to characterize the RFI source in NenuFAR data and study its impact on the power spectrum. Modeling and subtraction of the RFI source will allow the full utilization of over 1000 hours of observation already taken with NenuFAR. This analysis will also aid other telescopes that face similar challenges in overcoming the contamination by local RFI emitters.</p>

        <p><strong>Quantifying the full sky foreground wedge: </strong>The biggest obstacle to the detection of the 21-cm signal is the astrophysical foreground emission that dominates the faint background signal. The foregrounds are expected to occupy a region in the cylindrical power spectrum called the foreground wedge. However, the conventional equations that describe the boundaries of the foreground wedge for phase tracking instruments are derived under a flat sky approximation. In this project, we derive and validate the full-sky foreground wedge equations without imposing a flat sky approximation and show that the foregrounds can extend well beyond previously thought. These equations give us new insights into the nature of foreground contamination in the power spectrum and will help plan future 21-cm observation and detection strategies.

        <p><strong>First upper limits on the 21-cm signal with NenuFAR: </strong>A detection of the 21-cm signal from the early universe will revolutionize our understanding of astrophysics and cosmology. In this project, we use the new radio telescope NenuFAR and perform an end-to-end analysis of a single night of observations. After subtracting the foregrounds, we find that the residuals are dominated by strong excess power beyond the thermal noise. We place upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at z = 20.3. These are the strongest upper limits on the 21-cm signal at z > 20. We also investigate the nature of the excess power, which is crucial for detecting the signal with NenuFAR in the future.

        <p><strong>Radio imaging with SWAN: </strong> The Sky Watch Array Network (SWAN) is a radio interferometric array located in Gauribidanur, India, and operated by RRI India. The SWAN initiative aims to develop a pan-India radio interferometer at low frequencies with VLBI capabilities, by placing stations at educational institutions across India. In this analysis, we used the Phase 0 setup of SWAN consisting of 8 tiles at Gauribidanur to observe and image the Sun. This involved accurate delay calibration and the development of a correlation and imaging pipeline for the raw data recorded by SWAN. The resulting image is the first interferometric image produced with SWAN. The paper can be found <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-022-1428-9" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

        <p><strong>HI intensity mapping on the EGS field with GMRT: </strong>In the post-reionization universe, the neutral hydrogen is confined in the interior of galaxies where it is shielded from ionizing radiation. HI intensity mapping is a method in which radio interferometers are used to construct low-resolution maps of the integrated 21-cm emission from a large number of galaxies. In this project, we analyze observations of the Extended Groth Strip made using the upgraded GMRT. We model and subtract foregrounds and use the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) to estimate the power spectrum of the data directly from the visibilities. We obtain constraints on the quantity &Omega;<sub>HI</sub>b<sub>HI</sub> at z = 0.028, 0.34, and 0.38.

        <p><strong>Accurate flux measurement of extended sources: </strong>The flux in radio interferometric images is usually reported in units of Jansky/clean-beam. Images after deconvolution are the sum of the clean and residual components. The relevant beam for the residual component is the dirty beam, which by definition has zero area. However, usually, the residual component flux is also reported in units of Jansky/clean-beam, which leads to incorrect flux estimation for shallow cleans with high residual flux. In this project, we use Jorsater and van Moorsel's algorithm to estimate the true flux in radio interferometric images.

        <p><strong>Broadband characterization of GX 17+2 using HXMT: </strong> The Low Mass X-ray Binary GX 17+2 is a Z source and is known to exhibit a state-dependent hard tail above energies of 30 keV predominantly while in the horizontal and flaring branches of the X-ray colour-colour diagram. In this project, we use Insight-HXMT data from about one year to study the spectral properties of the source as it occupies different positions in the X-ray hardness-intensity diagram. We find evidence of a hard tail when the source occupies the horizontal and flaring branches.  An iron fluorescence line is detected only when the source is in the flaring branch.

        <p><strong>Optical and infrared variability of a high mass X-ray binary: </strong> IGR17544-2619 is a supergiant fast X-ray transient, a type of HMXB. In this project, we analyze simultaneous optical, infrared, and X-ray data for this source and construct their light curves. We developed an automated pipeline to construct differential lightcurves from optical and infrared images using IRAF, Sextractor, Scamp, and Swarp. We find evidence of a correlation between the X-ray and optical lightcurves, with a slight lag, which might indicate optical reprocessing of the X-ray photons in the accretion disk.
