        <p><strong>Observations of a "dark" field for 21-cm Cosmology with NenuFAR:</strong> A detection of the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn will revolutionize our understanding of the early universe. In our first analysis of NenuFAR data, we found that one of the main limiting factors preventing the detection of the signal with NenuFAR is the strong astrophysical foreground emission coming in through the primary beam grating lobes, far from the field of view. To overcome this difficulty, we initiated a survey of six different fields with NenuFAR, carefully chosen to minimize contamination from bright radio sources and diffuse galactic emission. A preliminary analysis of the data from this survey shows promising results and one of the fields has been chosen for deep integration. In this project, we plan to process a single night of observations of this field, to derive strong upper limits on the 21-cm signal that will allow us to constrain astrophysical parameters during the Cosmic Dawn. </p>
