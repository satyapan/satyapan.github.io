        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>Hello, I am Satyapan Munshi, a PhD candidate at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in Groningen, Netherlands. My research interests are in radio interferometry and observational cosmology. Currently, I am working in the group of Prof. Leon Koopmans, on observational 21-cm cosmology. We are trying to detect the 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the early universe using low-frequency radio interferometers. More specifically, I am working on using the radio telescope NenuFAR, to explore the Cosmic Dawn, an era when the first stars in the universe were formed.</p>
        <p> Before this, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali with a major in physics and a minor in astronomy. For my master's thesis with Prof. Jasjeet Singh Bagla, we performed HI intensity mapping on the Extended Groth Strip field observed with the upgraded GMRT, to derive upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum in the post reionization universe.</p>
